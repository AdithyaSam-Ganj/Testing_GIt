# Spotify-Capstone-Project
I was planning to create a ML model to implement spotify recommendation system based on content based filtering. The main reason for this project is to showcase my data science skills in python. I also want to explore how to use Spotify API, and work on bringing my project into full production so my friends can use it on the internet.
